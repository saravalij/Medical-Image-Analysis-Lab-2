# Medical-Image-Analysis-Lab-2

This Laboratory Practice consists of implementing different image segmentation techniques to several medical images.

The segmentation_f file, which contains several functions, is imported into the three Jupyter Noteeboks: The first one performs Region Growing-based image segmentation, the second one implements the Watershed algorithm and the third one applies the Active Contours method to the imported images.
